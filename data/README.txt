RAS data was the only data I wanted that is not included in the nfl_data_py. RAS is a measure of relative althletic score, a score which
is calculated from combine testing data and physical measurements. RAS is a comperative score, so players are ranked in comparision to
how other players ranked at their position. It's being increasingly used as the years go on and has been shown to be a good way to measure all of the
atheletic traits of a prospect into one score. Data was taken from https://ras.football/. Full credit to Kent Lee Platte aka MathBomb on twitter for
the devolpment of RAS.
